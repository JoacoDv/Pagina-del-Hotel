## 🛠️ Structure and Code

| Feature                     | WordPress                              | Static Version                         |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Content generation         | Automated via plugins and themes       | Manually crafted, fully customized     |
| Code control               | Limited (theme/template-dependent)     | Total control over layout and behavior |
| Plugin dependency          | High                                    | None                                   |
| Page weight                | Heavy due to unused dependencies       | Lightweight, loads only what's needed  |

## ⚡ Performance

| Aspect                          | WordPress                              | Static Version                         |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Load time                       | Slower (PHP + database calls)          | Fast, no backend needed                |
| Core Web Vitals                 | Unstable due to scripts and plugins    | Optimized and consistent               |
| CLS (Layout Shift)             | Frequent with sliders and images       | Eliminated with fixed-size WebP images |
| Image format                    | JPEG/PNG                               | WebP for smaller size and faster load  |

## 🎨 Customization

| Element                    | WordPress                              | Static Version                         |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Image carousel            | Limited to plugin functionality        | Fully custom carousel, smooth and modern |
| Multi-language support    | Requires heavy plugins                 | Lightweight, JavaScript-based          |
| Responsive design         | Theme-dependent                        | Handcrafted with media queries         |
| Text content              | Often generic or templated             | Rewritten for clarity and engagement   |

|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Navigation                | Auto-generated menus                   | Clean, responsive, user-friendly       |
| Scroll & animations       | Minimal or clunky                      | Smooth transitions and interactivity   |
| WhatsApp/contact buttons  | Often static or poorly placed          | Dynamically displayed based on screen and scroll |

## 📦 Conclusion
